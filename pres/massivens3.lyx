Collaborative Nested Sampling: Big Data vs.

\begin_layout Abstract
The data torrent unleashed by current and upcoming astronomical surveys
 demands scalable analysis methods.
 Machine learning approaches scale well.
 However, separating the instrument measurement from the physical effects
 of interest, dealing with variable errors, and deriving parameter uncertainties
 is usually an after-thought.
 Classic forward-folding analyses with Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Nested
 Sampling enable parameter estimation and model comparison, even for complex
 and slow-to-evaluate physical models.
 However, these approaches require independent runs for each data set, implying
 an unfeasible number of model evaluations in the Big Data regime.
 Here I present a new algorithm, collaborative nested sampling, for deriving
 parameter probability distributions for each observation.
 Importantly, the number of physical model evaluations scales sub-linearly
 with the number of data sets, and no assumptions about homogeneous errors,
 Gaussianity, the form of the model or heterogeneity/completeness of the
 observations need to be made.
 Collaborative nested sampling has immediate application in speeding up
 analyses of large surveys, integral-field-unit observations, and Monte
 Carlo simulations.

.
 In the previous century it was common to analyse a few dozen objects in
 detail.
 For instance, one would use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to forward fold a
 physical model and constrain its parameters.
 This would be repeated for each member of the sample.
 However, current and upcoming instruments provide a wealth of data (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 millions of independent sources) where it becomes computationally difficult
 to follow the same approach, even though it is embarrassingly parallel.
 Currently, much effort is put into studying and applying machine learning
 algorithms such as (deep learning) neural networks or random forests for
 the analysis of massive datasets.
 This can work well if the measurement errors are homogeneous, but typically
 these methods make it difficult to insert existing physical knowledge into
 the analysis, to deal with variable errors and missing data points, and
 generally to separate the instrument measurement process from the physical
 effects of interest.
 Furthermore, we would like to derive probability density distributions
 of physical parameters for each object, and do model comparison between
 physical effects/sources classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work I show how nested sampling can be used to analyse 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 data sets simultaneously.
 The key insight is that nested sampling allows effective sharing of evaluation
 points across data sets, requiring much fewer model evaluations than if
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 data sets were analysed individually.
 I only assume that the model can be split into two components: a slow-to-evalua
te physical model which performs a prediction into observable space, and
 a fast-to-compute comparison to the individual data sets (e.g.
 the likelihood of a probability distribution).
 Otherwise, the user is free to chose arbitrary physical models and likelihoods.

Illustration of nested sampling.
 At a given iteration of the nested sampling algorithm, the live points
 (black) trace out the current likelihood constraint, a region (dashed)
 which is unknown.
 The

 everything within a certain, adaptively chosen radius of the current live
 points.
 Between iterations, the likelihood contour is elevated, making the sampled

Nested sampling 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 is a global parameter space exploration algorithm, which zooms in from
 the entire volume towards the best-fit models by steadily increasing the
 likelihood threshold.
 In the process it produces parameter posterior probability distributions
 and computes the integral over the parameter space.
 Assume that the parameter space is a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-dimensional cube.
 A number of live points 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{{\rm live}}$
\end_inset

 are randomly

In general, following the prior.
 For most problems one can assume uniform sampling with appropriate stretching
 of the parameter space under the inverse cumulative of the prior distributions.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 placed in the parameter space.
 Their likelihood is evaluated.
 Each point represents 
\begin_inset Formula $1/N_{{\rm live}}$
\end_inset

 of the entire volume.
 The live point with the lowest likelihood 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{{\rm min}}$
\end_inset

 is then removed, implying the removal of space with likelihood below 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{{\rm min}}$
\end_inset

 and shrinkage of the volume to 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\exp\left(-1/N_{{\rm live}}\right)$
\end_inset

, on average.
 A new random live point is drawn, with the requirement that its likelihood
 must be above 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{{\rm min}}$
\end_inset

.
 This replacement procedure is iterated, shrinking the volume exponentially.
 Each removed (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dead
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) point and its likelihood 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}$
\end_inset

 is stored.
 The integral over the parameter space can then be approximated by 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=\sum_{i}L_{i}\times w_{i}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the removed volume at the iteration.
 At a late stage in the algorithm the volume probed is tiny and the likelihood
 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}$
\end_inset

 increase is negligible, so that the weights 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}\times w_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the remaining live points becomes small.
 Then the iterative procedure can be stopped (the algorithm converged).
 The posterior probability distribution of the parameters is approximated
 as importance samples of weight 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}\times w_{i}$
\end_inset

 at the dead point locations, and can be resampled into a set of points
 with equal weights, for posterior analyses similar to those with Markov
 Chains.

Efficient general solutions exist for drawing a new point above a likelihood
 threshold in low dimensions (
\begin_inset Formula $n_{{\rm dim}}<20$
\end_inset

).
 The idea is to draw only in the neighbourhood of the current live points,
 which already fulfill the likelihood threshold.
 The best-known algorithm in astrophysics and cosmology is 
\shape smallcaps

\shape default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 There, the contours traced out by the points are clustered into ellipses,
 and new points drawn from the ellipses.
 To avoid accidentally cutting away too much of the parameter space, the
 tightest-fitting ellipses are enlarged by an empirical (problem-specific)
 factor.
 Another algorithm is 
\shape smallcaps
RadFriends
\shape default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, which defines the neighbourhood as all points within a radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 of an existing live point.
 By leaving out randomly a portion of the live points, and determining their
 distance to the remaining live points, the largest nearest-neighbour radius
 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is determined.
 The worst-case analysis through bootstrapping cross-validation over multiple
 rounds makes

 is efficient if one chooses a standardised euclidean metric (i.e.

 I use this algorithm below, however any other method can be substituted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Simplified description of the idea
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider two independent nested sampling runs on different data sets, but
 initialised to the same random number generator state.
 Initially points are generated from across the entire parameter space,
 typically giving bad fits.
 If the data sets are somewhat similar, the phase of zooming to the relevant
 parameter space will be the same for the two runs.
 Importantly, while the exact likelihood value will be different for the
 same point, the ordering of the points will be similar.
 In other words, for both, the worst-fitting point to be removed is the
 same.
 The next key insight is that new points can be drawn efficiently from a
 contour which is the union of the likelihood contours from both runs.
 Ideally, the point can be accepted by both runs, keeping the runs similar
 (black points in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:illustration-pointsharing"

\end_inset

).
 When a point is shared, the (slow) predicting model has to be only evaluated
 once, speeding up the run.
 The model prediction is then compared against the data to produce a likelihood
 for each data set, an operation which I presume to be fast, e.g., when computing
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
{\cal L}_{j}=-\sum_{i}(x_{ij}-m_{i})^{2}/(2\sigma_{ij}^{2})\label{eq:chisquare}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{ij}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{ij}$
\end_inset

 are the predictions, measurements and errors in data space respectively
 for data set

The analysis of two similar data sets yields at the same iteration similar
 likelihood contours (the two dotted ellipses).
 In the presented algorithm a large fraction of live points are shared across
 data sets (black points), which reduces the number of model evaluations.

 draws.

\end_layout

\end_inset

What if the point can be accepted by only one run? It cannot simply be rejected
 or accepted in both, otherwise the uniform sampling property of nested
 sampling is broken.
 Instead, accepted points are stored in queues, one for each run/data set.
 Once both runs have a non-empty queue, the first accepted point is removed
 from each queue and replaces the dead point of each data set.
 Joint sampling also helps even if a point is not useful right away.
 If a point was only accepted by run A, but the following point is accepted
 by both runs, the second point becomes a live point immediately for run
 B, but can later also become a live point for run A (if it suffices the
 likelihood threshold at that later iteration).
 This technique allows sustained sharing of points, decreasing the number
 of unique live points and increasing the speed-up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At a later point in the algorithm, the contours may significantly diverge
 and not share any live points.
 This is because the best-fit parameters of data sets will differ.
 Then, nested sampling runs can continue as in the classic case, without
 speed-up, falling back to a linear scaling.
 This happens earlier, the more different the data sets are.
 The run is longer for data sets with high signal-to-noise, making the algorithm
 most efficient when most observations are near the detection limit.
 This is typically the case in surveys as a consequence of powerlaw distribution
s.
\end_layout

Collaborative nested sampling

\begin_layout Standard
I now describe the collaborative nested sampling algorithm.

.
 The algorithm components are the nested sampling integrator, the constrained
 sampler and the likelihood function, as in classic nested sampling, except
 that works on 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 data sets simultaneously, with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 a large number.
 The constrained sampler behaves substantially different in this algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Likelihood Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The likelihood function receives a single parameter vector, and information
 which data sets to consider.
 It calls the physical model with the parameter vector to compute into a
 prediction into data space.
 The physical model may perform complex and slow numerical computations/simulati
ons at this point.
 Finally the prediction is compared with the individual data sets to produce
 a likelihood for each considered data set.
 The likelihood at this point can be Gaussian (see above), Poisson, a red
 noise process, or any other probability distribution appropriate for the
 instrument.
 In any case, this computation must be fast compared with producing the
 model predictions to receive any performance gains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Nested Sampling Integrator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The integrator deals with each run individually just as in standard nested
 sampling.
 It keeps track of the remaining volume at the current iteration, and storing
 the live points and their weights for each data set individually.
 It calls the constrained sampler (see below), which holds the live points,
 to receive the next dead point (for all data sets simultaneously).
 The integrator must also test for convergence, and advance further only
 those runs which have not yet converged.
 Here I use the standard criterion that the nested sampling error is 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta Z<0.5$
\end_inset

 (from last equation in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "skilling2009nested"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 Once all runs have terminated, corresponding to each data set the integral
 estimates 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 and posterior samples are returned, giving the user the same output as
 e.g., a 
\shape smallcaps

 analysis.

To replace the least likely live point, new points are sampled and placed

 Once every data set has a non-empty queue, the lowest points are pushed

The sampler initially draws 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{{\rm live}}$
\end_inset

 live points and stores their likelihoods in an array of size 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times N_{{\rm live}}$
\end_inset

.
 Sequential IDs are assigned to live points and the mapping between live
 point IDs and data sets (
\begin_inset Formula $N\times N_{{\rm live}}$
\end_inset

 indices) is stored.
 The integrator informs the sampler when it should remove the lowest likelihood
 point and replace it.
 The integrator also informs the sampler when some data sets have finished
 and can be discarded from further consideration, in which case the sampler
 works as if they had never participated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main task of the constrained sampler is to do joint draws under likelihood
 constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $L>L_{{\rm min}}$
\end_inset

 to replace the lowest likelihood point in each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 data sets.
 For this, 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 initially empty queues are introduced (see Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:queues"

\end_inset

).
 First, it is attempted to draw from the joint contour over all data sets
 (
\emph on
superset draw
\emph default
), i.e.
 letting 
\shape smallcaps
RadFriends
\shape default
 define a region based on the all unique live points.
 From this region a point is drawn which has 
\begin_inset Formula $L>L_{{\rm min}}$
\end_inset

 for at least one data set.
 Some will accept and the corresponding queues are filled.
 If this fails to fill all queues after several (e.g.
 10) attempts, a 
\emph on
focussed draw
\emph default
 is done.
 In that case, only the data sets with empty queues are considered, the
 region is constructed from their live points, and the likelihood only evaluated
 for these data sets.
 For example, in the illustration of Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:queues"

\end_inset

, only Data Set 3 would be considered.
 Once all queues have at least one entry, nested sampling can advance: For
 each data set, the first queue entry is removed and replaces the dead live
 point.
 In Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:queues"

\end_inset

 this is illustrated by the queues pushing out the lowest live points.
 These dead points are returned to the integrator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Storing queue entries is only useful if they can replace live points in
 the upcoming iterations.
 Playing nested sampling forward this implies that to be accepted into the
 end of the queue at position 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, it must have a likelihood higher than 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 points from the runs live points and previous entries of the queue.
 In other words, the first entry must merely beat a single existing live
 point, the second entry must beat both a live point and either another
 live point or the first queue entry (which will become a live point in
 the next iteration).

Association of live point objects with data sets.
 In this illustration, some live points are shared between the group of
 Data Set 1-3; these form a connected subgraph.
 Data Set 4 has separate live points and can be treated independently.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can occur that between two groups of data sets the live points are not
 shared any more, i.e.
 the live point sets are disjoint.
 For example, one may have a dichotomy between broad and narrow line objects,
 and the contours identify some of the data sets in the former, some in
 the latter class.
 Then it is not useful to consider all live points when defining the region,
 because it introduces unnecessary multi-modality.
 Instead, subsets can be identified which share live points (see Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:graph"

\end_inset

), and these subsets can be processed independently.
 Algorithms for identifying connected subsets of graphs are well-known.
 The necessary graph can be constructed with nodes corresponding to the
 data sets, nodes corresponding to the live points, and connecting the graph
 according to the current live point statuses.
 This introduces some computational overhead, especially for large 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{{\rm live}}$
\end_inset

.
 However, one can lazily defer graph construction and maintenance until
 they are needed.
 A few simple checks can trivially rule out disjoint subsets: If there are
 fewer unique live points across all data sets than 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times N_{{\rm live}}$
\end_inset

, some must be shared and there are no disjoint subsets.
 We can also track any live point which has been accepted by all data sets.
 Any such a 
\emph on
superpoint
\emph default
, until one data set removes it as a dead point, guarantees that there are
 no disconnected subsets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The described analysis of divergence of contours effectively clusters data
 sets by similarity.
 Interestingly, the similarity is not defined in data space, nor in parameter
 space, but only through the constraints in parameter space.
 This is important because clustering in data space can be non-trivial for
 data with varying errors and completeness, and clustering in parameter
 space would scale poorly with model dimensionality.
 Instead, the likelihood ordering that makes nested sampling unique is taken
 advantage of.
 The clustering improves the efficiency of region draws, as it eliminates
 space between clusters.
 It also improves super-set draws as unrelated data sets, which cannot benefit,
 are not pulled in.

This application demonstrates the usefulness of collaborative nested sampling
 in a realistic dataset.
 Physical parameters were extracted while exploiting that spatial neighbours
 have similar physical properties.
 However, no assumption about smoothness or neighbourhood was made, i.e.,
 the constraints at each pixel are independent.
 Also note that in every pixel, a posterior distribution over the parameters
 is derived.
 Here, the collaborative nested sampling analysis of 4223 fibers required
 14.4 million likelihood evaluations (140h).
 This corresponds to a quadrupling of the efficiency compared to analysing
 only 100 fibers, which required 2.8 million likelihood evaluations (14.9h).

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Collaborative nested sampling is a scalable algorithm suitable for analysing
 massive data sets with arbitrarily complex physical models and complex,
 inhomogeneous noise properties.
 The algorithm brings to the Big Data regime parameter estimation with uncertain
ties, classification of objects and distinction between physical processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key insight in this work is to take advantage of a property specific
 to nested sampling: The sampling regions can look similar across similar
 data sets, and rejection sampling from the union of contours is permitted

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As in classic nested sampling, the volume shrinkage estimates are valid
 on average.
 Multiple runs can test whether this leads to additional scatter in the
 integral estimate.
 In practice, single runs already give correct uncertainties for many problems.

 reduces the number of unique model evaluations, in particular at the beginning
 of the nested sampling run.
 The same approach cannot be followed with Markov Chain proposals: There,
 the proposal depends on the current point, and deviating acceptances prohibit
 a later joint proposal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The algorithm has some overhead related to the management of live points,
 in particularly to determine the unique set of live points across a dynamically
 selected subgroup of data sets.
 The memory usage also grows if big data sets have to be held in the same
 machine.
 If only chunks of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 are managable, the analyses can be split into such sizes and analysed in
 parallel across multiple machines.
 In that case, one can take advantage of the scaling of the algorithm until
 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The algorithm can be applied immediately to any existing large data sets.
 Compared to other Big Data analysis approaches, nested sampling supports
 model comparison and yields full probability distributions on arbitrary
 models, allowing the exploration of degenerate fit solutions.
 Furthermore, the instrument response can be modelled out and separated
 from the process of interest.

.
 The position-dependent detector response and non-Gaussianity of count data
 make standard machine learning approaches difficult to apply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even in the analysis of single objects the presented algorithm can help.
 One might test the correctness of selecting a more complex model, e.g., based
 on Bayes factors, as in the toy example presented.
 Large Monte Carlo simulations of a null hypothesis model can be quickly
 analysed with the presented method, with a model evaluation cost that is
 essentially independent of the number of generated data sets.
